# **Visual LEGv8 Simulator** (In Development)

The **Visual LEGv8 Simulator** is a web-based simulator for a subset of ARM instructions, designed to help users understand instruction execution step by step. This project draws inspiration from the [Graphical Micro-Architecture Simulator](https://github.com/arm-university/Graphical-Micro-Architecture-Simulator).  

Since I am currently taking a college course on ARM programming, there may be inaccuracies in the implementation. If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, feel free to reach out at **kennedyonyema-willys@my.unt.edu**.  

> **Note:** This tool is still in development.  

## **Features**  
✅ Web-based, cross-platform—no installation required  
✅ Built-in code editor for writing and testing LEGv8 assembly  
✅ Step-by-step execution visualization  
✅ Designed for educational use  

## **Prerequisites**  
- Basic knowledge of assembly programming  

## **License**
